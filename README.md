Official GitHub Repository for paper Caterpillar Traps: A Highly Flexible, Distributed System of Toroidal Cable Traps. In this work, we developed a novel, distributed design of cable traps, which we call Caterpillar Traps, that can allow for the coil cable to remain light, flexible and easy to use. Caterpillar traps provide sufficient attenuation to shield currents while allowing cable flexibility. Our distributed design can provide high blocking efficiency at different positions and orientations, even in cases where commercial cable traps cannot.

In this repository, we include a [document](https://github.com/mikgroup/Caterpillar-Traps/blob/d7731b9c5b30fe11cb3cb2542e44321b4137ca70/Clamp-on%20and%20Closed%20Twisted%20Pair%20Toroids%20Fabrication%20Details.pdf) that includes the necessary steps in order to fabricate our cable trap design.
